## Background

It's tough to be a dog walker! Luckily, petsitfor.me can help manage your clients and daily schedule, while also providing functionality for owners to view and cancel appointments, leave reviews for walkers, and keep track of their dog or cat's "numbers."

## Features

+ Parsed NYC Open Data to populate the app
+ Implemented a custom interactive map by utilizing the D3 JS library
+ Incorporated the Google Maps API to convert user input in to latitude and longitudes
+ Utilized AJAX requests create a seamless, intuitive single page app

## Development/Contribution

Wanna write some tests? Wanna chart some poops?

## Future

- Full test coverage
- Better server integration
- Allow owners to make appointments through the application
- Allow walkers to see their schedule past the current day
- Allow poop chart to include info about whether the pet was fed, or peed, and info on all past poops (rather than just the past 7 days)

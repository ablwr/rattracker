Minimal Loveable Product

-make root page with a form for zipcode
-read up on conversion of csv into SQL form
-make sure data formats match SQL
-read up on D3 and how it works with csv
-show page displaying data (not necessarily D3, maybe raw data)
-make scatter plot
-make Google Maps plotted out spots page

Extra Cool Junk

-have a live feed
-convert zipcodes to neighborhoods
-put it on a single page
-date selector to choose date range
-make some fun front end rat themed stuff
-find top rat infested neighborhoods or buildings or blocks/areas and share it
-making map dot bigger for buildings/areas with multiple complaints
